## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

In this project i tried to use Grid as much as i could, and in particular i used the grid area to ensure the correct positioning of the elements on larger screens. The design was built with a mobile first approach. I also learned the matchMedia method in JS, which allowed me to apply my code only on small viewport.

### Continued development

I want to keep focusing on CSS and get better and better with it, as well as practice JS fundamentals
